# Briefy About Myself:
My goal and dream is to become a professional web-developer, so I dedicate all my time to educatioan and self-educatione. I chose the IT field because I can endlessly learn something new and never stagnate. I started my immersion in programming with Python back-end development and continue to explore the possibilities of the language, frameworks and libraries. During the training, I realized that I lack the front-end development skills to develop full-fledged and high-quality portfolio projects, so I immersed myself in learning JavaScript. \
Before studying programming, I studied international law at university, and then was a co-founder and manager of my own restaurant.
